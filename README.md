## Tasks Explanation

### Task 1: arrayManipulation.js

- **processArray:** This function takes an array of numbers as an argument. It returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.

### Task 2: arrayManipulation.js

- **formatArrayStrings:** This function takes two arrays as arguments: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`. It modifies each string based on its corresponding number by capitalizing the entire string if the number is even and converting the string to lowercase if the number is odd.

### Task 3: userInfo.js

- **createUserProfiles:** This function takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2. It returns an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and `id` (auto-incremented starting from 1).
